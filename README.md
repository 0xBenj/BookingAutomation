# Tutorly

## Project Overview

Tutorly is a platform designed to connect students with tutors for personalized learning experiences. The application helps students find qualified tutors in various subjects, schedule sessions, and manage their learning journey efficiently. Tutors can manage their availability, connect with students, and grow their tutoring business.

### Key Features
- Student-tutor matching based on subject needs
- Scheduling and calendar integration
- Secure messaging between students and tutors
- Session tracking and progress reporting
- Payment processing for tutoring services

## Environment Setup

For the application to work correctly, you need to set up the following environment variables:

### Client-side Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with:
```
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_public_key
```

### Server-side Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the server directory with:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
PORT=3001
# Other server environment variables...
```

Note: Never commit your actual Stripe keys to version control. The prefixes should be:
- For test mode: pk_test_... and sk_test_...
- For production: pk_live_... and sk_live_...

## Development Information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
